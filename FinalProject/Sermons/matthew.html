        <P>
         “Away in a manger, no crib for his bed, the little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.” Probably the first song I learned in Sunday school was “Away in the Manger”. It is sweet, simple and a lullaby. The purpose of the song is to create a sense of calm and gentleness. Children have been taught that song for as long as I can remember. As adults we love to hear them sing it. Their voices are fresh and eager, naive and earnest.
         <P>
        Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, my son, Chris, put up our Christmas tree, and my wife put out the crèche (or as my Methodist parents called it, “The Manger Scene.”) We are preparing for Christmas.
        <P>
        Today is the first Sunday in Advent, the season in which you and I prepare our hearts for the incarnation of God’s love in Jesus Christ. The Gospel text which the high priests of the lectionary have chosen for today is one in which we are sternly warned to “WAKE UP” and “BE READY” for the coming of the Son of Man. “You are going to have to choose. How you choose will make a difference.” This thinking is right in line with the other passages that we have had over the previous three or four weeks.        
        <P>
        What I find intriguing is that in this passage in St. Matthew’s Gospel Jesus refers to two attitudes towards life that are found in two differing types of literature. When Jesus talks about the days of Noah, Jesus is citing legend. It is a legend about life in the time of Noah. The legend points toward human behavior that is sybaritic, narcissistic and hedonistic. Excessive emphasis is placed upon the pleasures of the flesh. Eating, drinking and marriage pleasure are the summum bonum of life, the be all and end of all of “the good life.”  According to this legend, God punished mankind by sending a flood that was far more destructive than Katrina that hit New Orleans. The fact that this story is a legend does not mean that we should hold it in contempt for being a legend. Not at all, for it points to the ultimate futility of excessive self-gratification behavior. Such behavior is immoral and destructive of religion, individuals and society.  
        <P> 
        The second type of literature to which Jesus refers is wisdom literature. Such literature is found in the books of Job, Ecclesiastes, Proverbs and some of the Psalms. It is literature that contains observations on life. The image of two women grinding meal together and one taken and one left is almost verbatim out of Ecclesiastes. “Vanity. All is vanity.” Much of wisdom literature tends to be fatalistic, negative, stoic and cynical. Life is tough. First you live and then you die. You are a victim of fortune and despair is an appropriate response. In many ways it reminds me of Albert Camus’ The Plague, a novel written after WWII, which presented the philosophy of French existential philosophers. You are born. Life is meaningless. It lacks real values. You are slightly better off than a bug.
        <P>
        Jesus’ response to these two differing attitudes (over indulgence or despair) is to present a message of hope based on decision and judgment. The coming of the Son of Man will always catch us by surprise. When faced with critical times you and I are given the opportunity to choose and to respond to God’s overtures to us.  
        <P>
        Now what occurs to me is that we have in this passage from Matthew a paradigm, or model for our responses to the coming of Christmas. We have in our culture now something called “Black Friday.” I thought that phrase referred to a stock market crash. But no. It refers to the Friday right after Thanksgiving. It is the day in which retail stores gauge how their holiday seasonal sales will be. Hence the stores open at four in the morning and run frantic sales of their goodies. You and I are encouraged to buy, buy, buy. It is not, “Sleepers awake!” It is, “Shoppers awake!” Shades of Noah’s sons!
        <P>
        I think all of us feel pulled in the direction of buying gifts and giving gifts that will bring pleasure both to the receiver and to the giver. My own family has yielded to this pressure from time to time. In fact, we are going to have twenty persons at our house for Christmas! Isn’t that great? And we are all going to give gifts! Unfortunately I am mathematically challenged but you figure out how many gifts there would be if we each bought twenty gifts to give to the twenty who will be there. (400?) As a result, my wife and her sister-in-law run scenarios for gift giving. “We could all pull one name from a hat.” Or, We could limit giving to our immediate family,” they tell us. But, hey, I like to get gifts. That is okay for the other people but I want a gift from each of the twenty; after all, I’m the host and giving is good, especially if I am the recipient. Could it be that I am a true son of Noah?
        <P>
        Maybe not. For many years I have stopped going to Target, or Wal-Mart or other stores at Christmas time because I cannot bear to see people pushing shopping carts around that are overloaded with plastic goodies and clothing made in China. Most of the stuff is cheap and bespeaks an urge to fill a void, a desire to make up for a hole that is in the family relationships and the soul. Thirty years ago we had Christmases like that. The whole family would gather at our house and we could barely get into the living room because it was stuffed with gifts. One of the relatives always had to go over the top, and the year I remember is when all of the gifts had been exchanged, he set a new standard for giving. He gave a suede coat with a mink collar to my wife, her sister and my mother-in-law. We were all stunned. He was trying to atone for years misspent. He wanted so badly to erase poor choices. His family didn’t want gifts. They just wanted him to be well and to let us love him.   
        <P>
        The other attitude towards Christmas is one that my mother had, and that many of us have. It is one of despair. “Vanity. All is vanity.” The expectations of love and joy and good times are too painful for us to bear. Christmas was the hardest time of the year for my mother because her mother was born on Christmas day and had died tragically. My mother dearly missed my grandmother. Mother suffered from what psychologists call “the Christmas blues.” I suffer from them as well. At Christmas for years I have always wanted to just go off by my self and sit alone in a room. I feel like one of the wisdom writers, “Life is lousy; all is futile; some have a good time and then it is over. Vanity. All is vanity.”
        <P>
        Those of you who embrace a “Kincaid Christmas” and the Hallmark fun of kitsch and festivities, please be tender to those of us who suffer. We are genuinely in pain.
        <P>
        You and I do not need to embrace either the bacchanalian excesses of Noah’s time or the despair of the picture of the two women grinding meal, waiting for one of them to die. We cannot help feeling pulled between the two poles of attitudes (excess or despair) in our preparations for Christmas. During Advent we cannot help but feel stress and anxiety as the Christmas season comes closer and closer upon us.   
        <P>
        There is, however, a third way to approach Christmas, and that is to come to the manger. In Advent come to the manager and wait. Wait for the story to unfold. Lay up your hopes and aspirations, your trials and tribulations before the manager. Wait. In your heart say, “Here I am God. Take all of me. Let me awaken to your promise and your gift. Take my packages of anxiety and stress, fear and regret, emptiness and confusion. Wrap them in the swaddling garments of your compassion and love, your hope and grace. Help me to wake up to the glory of your graciousness and the splendor of your face.”   
        <P>
        These Sundays in Advent, prepare to bring your heart to the manager scene, and to bring the hearts of others to that manger, in a stable in a small town in a far distant place. We do that through our prayers, through our scriptural readings, through our liturgy, through our outreach and through our piety. It mattereth not if we don’t have the perfect Christmas tree, guest list, or gifts. What does matter is that we bring our hearts and souls to the manger, to the incarnation of God’s love. What matters is that we direct our lives towards that which is most positive, creative and recreative, affirming and reaffirming – namely God’s gift of Himself in the innocence of a newborn babe and the incarnation of complete forgiveness and compassion. What matters most is that you and I share that love and compassion in how we live with ourselves and with one another. It mattereth not if our lives are not perfect. What does matter is how we treat ourselves and one another before the grace and beauty of God our Father as found in the child of the Virgin Mary.  
        So today, this first Sunday in Advent, when we light the first Advent candle, lay aside your concerns and come to the manager. This and every day allow your child-like innocence to bring you to where “the little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.” And “The stars in heavens look down where he lays, the little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.” This Advent, this day, this Christmas come to the manager. Amen.</P>

        <P>The Jews were looking for a Messiah. They had been through tough times: two exiles, civil wars and countless conquerors. Time and again prophets had arisen and called them to more careful observance of the law. Isaiah and others looked for a Messiah, a ruler who would raise up the nation. In the wilderness John the Baptist called for repentance and announced the coming of the Messiah. From prison he sent messengers to ask if Jesus were the promised one. Jesus replied that the blind see, the lame walk, the dead are raised, the poor have good news brought to them - messianic signs. Some doubted John. Jesus asked, “What do you want? A prophet in rich clothes, living in luxury and driving a Jaguar?” John in his animal skins is great, but those who enter the kingdom, who follow Jesus, are even greater.
        <P>
        Now I want to tell you a story. My wife, Faye, is doing workshops all over the state. She is part of The Connecticut Writing Project, which teaches teachers how to teach reading and writing. Faye has been doing extensive workshops in a town which is a good two hours drive from here. Last Friday she got up early and drove in the rain to start a workshop at 8:30 a.m. Faye has taught for 35 years, and she has taught at all grade levels, K-12. Friday she was giving a demonstration workshop, teaching six-year-olds, first graders. The unit was to teach them what a question is. What is it that makes a question as well as how to punctuate it. Now you have to get that complicated concept over to the kids, and it usually takes more imagination than just reading a Webster’s Dictionary definition to them. So the night before Faye made large cardboard question marks, which she pasted on l8 in sticks for the kids to act out being a question. In class the kids loved it and the teachers were mesmerized.
        <P>
        Afterwards a little black boy, Shawn, came up to her. Shawn was a very active kid. “I’d like you to come to my house and see my mother,” he said. “Oh, I don’t know where you live,” Faye replied. “Why don’t you have here come to school?” “I want you to see her because she says that I do bad in school. That’s what they tell her. And you said twice today that I did good. I want you to tell her that I did good!” Here was a little boy who was only told that he was bad. Can you imagine what he will be like when he is twelve? Where do you think he will be when he is eighteen?
        <P>
        Now that evening I worked on a survey that I am doing as a project on interim ministry. I wrote a survey and sent it to twenty-two interim ministers. I received back an email from a man who had trained me for the priesthood. He said that my survey was stupid, the questions irrelevant and a waste of time. I felt like Shawn. But I was old enough to realize that the man wasted a chance to make a friend. He could have made some helpful suggestions and also pointed out what was good as well as bad. I would have grown and he would have been both helpful and charitable. Another priest answered my survey and was really helpful. I felt like a new person! She acted like a real priest - an intercessor in learning and spiritual growth.
        <P>
        On a superficial level, I am saying “For God’s sake as Christians affirm one another. Be constructive and positive. On an other level my message is that as you and I approach Christmas, we metaphorically carry our cardboard questions before us. We know that we are bad and that we fail. But we are not flogged by the Law nor by a Messiah who seeks grandeur and glory, retribution and punishment. We come to the inn at Christmas to celebrate the incarnation of a gracious and compassionate God. We come to the birth of one who gives sight to the blind, cleanses the lepers, helps the deaf to hear, raises the dead and brings good news to the poor. This is a Messiah of good tidings - one who does not tell us that we are constantly bad, but tells us that we can be good - are good in Him. This is one who is God incarnate, who walks along with us, as we carry our big question marks on our faith journey. In Jesus you and I receive those very things which Shawn so desperately needs. You and I receive affirmation, love and hope. Amen.</P>

            <P>During the early forties in Illinois, if you wanted to have a lawn, you went out and broadcast the seed. You grabbed a handful and cast it over the ground. The grass would grow. Not all of it would take, but most of it. Some would fall on hard ground, and some among weeds, but generally it grew. Our neighbor, like a figure in a Flemish painting, would stride up and down broadcasting seed. When we moved to Kansas City in l950, Dad bought a drop-spreader. The grass seed and fertilizers would fall on the ground from the bottom of the spreader in an even, geometric pattern. Dad’s spreader had steel wheels. Sometimes, the holes would corrode, the screw would get clogged, or the adjustments slip. It was kind of a midwestern Methodist spreader. It worked, did the job, no frills.
            <P>
            In the late l950s Dad moved to Connecticut and brought his spreader and grass seeds with him. Dad lined up all of the grass seeds in neatly labeled Mason jars on a shelf at the end of the garage. There were red fescue, tall fescue, annual rye, perennial rye, and the top of the line: Kentucky blue grass. For Dad, the Kingdom of God was a thick rich turf of Kentucky blue grass. Along with the grass seeds were various fertilizers and lime. Dad spent endless hours preparing the soil and putting down fertilizers. Inevitably, he would tire himself out and the yard would have to wait until next year to get really on schedule and in good shape.
            <P>
            One of the first things I did when I came back East was to buy a Scotts’ drop spreader. This was the Episcopalian model. It was classic with a good finish, slightly better made and with an extra flair. I bought a mixture of blue grass and fescue, dumped it in the spreader, and walked around the yard. Once or twice a year, I would take a bucket of seed or fertilizer and broadcast it by hand. Dad lamented the fact that I had a better lawn than his. One Saturday, over ice tea, I told him the facts of life. I said, “Dad, you have a garage full of fertilizers and grass seeds. The problem is you don’t put them on the ground. You plan and prepare and schedule, but you have got to go out and throw the seed on the ground. The stuff is doing you no good in the garage. If you have to, just go out and broadcast the seed.” My father did not take kindly to my bluntness. He raked the lawn, turned over some of the dirt, and shortly thereafter had a heart attack and died. He was a good man. I felt bad that I made him feel bad. God’s love and activity is everlasting. It will grow and continue. It is not meant to be bottled up. Share it. He’ll do the rest. Amen.</P>
