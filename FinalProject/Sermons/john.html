        “Ezekiel connected them dry bones, Ezekiel connected them dry bones, Ezekiel connected them dry bones, Now hear the word of the Lord.”</P>
        <P>
        When I was a youngster, back in the 1940’s the Ink Spots used to sing this song on the Jimmy Durante show (radio). It is a great song. It speaks of Israel’s despair and being defeated by its enemies. Ezekiel in his apocalyptic vision proclaims that God will breathe new life into Israel and into His people.
        <P>
        The nation will rise. The people will rise. At the end of time there will be a final resurrection of the dead.
        <P>
        A great statement of faith and of hope.
        <P>
        For the Christian the resurrection is an individual phenomenon as well as something at the end of time. Christ’s own resurrection assures us of eternal life, individually with Him and we will join the communion saints in eternal life. In our creeds we speak of the resurrection of the dead, and we believe in a physical resurrection as well as a spiritual one. For the Christian body and soul and closely joined.
        <P>
        Now I am going to tell you three stories. The first is about a ten-year-old girl.
        <P>
        Twenty-seven years ago I worked as a chaplain at Stamford Hospital. I got a call one night at ten o’clock to go up on the second floor. A young girl had stopped breathing and the doctors and staff were frantically trying to get her to breathe. (I think she had cystic fibrosis, but I am not sure. Anyway she had aspirated.) The mother was hunched over in the corner and the father was standing in the doorway. He was four inches taller than I; about twenty pounds heavier, a state trooper and had a huge canon on his hip. The trooper was frantic. In order to reduce the tension and get some more space in the crowded room, I took him by the arm and lead him down to the end of the hallway, where we said a prayer. When we were finished he pointed to the room and said, “Go in there and pray for my daughter!” The doctors and staff had stepped back from the girl and were shaking their heads sadly. They couldn’t get her to breathe. I laid my hands on her head and prayed. Then I turned and left. As I went out into the hall someone exclaimed, “My God! She’s breathing! The girl recovered. I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up.
        <P>
        The next day, I said to my supervisor, “I’ve got a problem. This girl was either dead or dying and I prayed for her and she recovered.” My supervisor said to me, “What did you expect?” It was a testing of my faith. “As a priest you are called to witness to life: physical life and spiritual life. Life in the here and now and eternal life.
        <P>
        You are to witness to the power of healing in the ordinary and the extraordinary – in the medical and in the spiritual. You are to witness to the raising of the body and the raising of the spirit. You are called to witness to miracles in Christ Jesus.”
        <P>
        Now for my second story. Some years ago, the historian, William Manchester, had open-heart surgery. During the surgery the doctors discovered a bullet in his heart. He had been wounded in the Pacific in World War Two, treated by the medics and sewn up. No realized that there was a bullet still in him. For fifty years he had been walking around with a bullet on his heart.
        <P>
        That is an incredible metaphor for the human existence.
        <P>
        You and I walk around much of the time with a bullet, or at least a burden on our hearts. It may be grief over the loss of a child, a parent, a friend or a sibling. It may be resentment over ill treatment, or it may be the trauma of emotional or physical abuse. It may be problems with substance abuse, infertility, mental illness, the debilitating illness of a loved one. It may be the loss of a job or loss of one’s home.
        <P>
        In each of those situations there is a crying need for the breath of life, for healing and for hope. The spirit (soul) yearns for new life. The body resonates with the crying need of the spirit (soul).
        <P>
        And now for my final story, the story of the raising of Lazarus. The name “Lazarus” means, “God is my help.” It is the same as the name, “Eleazar”. (1) St. John tells us that Jesus was called to tend to his friend, Lazarus, who was on his deathbed. By the time Jesus arrived, Lazarus had been dead four days. Note the details in the story: stone, stench, bands of cloth. Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead. It is a miracle. Jesus was known not only as a teacher, prophet, rabbi but also as a healer and miracle worker. (There were people like that in His time.) But the story is remembered because it echoes the raising of the dead (Ezekiel’s Dry Bones) and the prophecies of Elijah that the coming Messiah would heal and raise the dead
        <P>
        The Lazarus story foreshadows Jesus’ own death and resurrection and the promise of Jesus of eternal life for those who believe in Him. It also underlines the close relationship between physical resurrection and spiritual resurrection: that the material and physical are inseparable.
        <P>
        As part of the Church you and I are called to give life. We are called to give life through love of God and of one another and through our lives, as we witness to the challenge and the assurance of the Gospel message.
        <P>
        As part of the Church you and I are also called to receive life. We are called to receive life in our bodies and in our souls. We receive that life thorough the power of the Holy Spirit (in baptism), through hearing the Word, through the sacraments (particularly the body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist) and through our participation in the life of the Church (the communion of saints).
        <P>
        My twenty-five years as a priest have shown me that body and spirit are inseparable, that the here and now is inseparable from the when and then (the future and eternity). I have seen new life in the lives and in the bodies of countless worshippers as they have passed through the doors and the liturgy of the church.
        <P>
        It is the call of the priest and of the layman to witness to new life – in body and spirit, in the now and in eternity, which we share in Jesus Christ. The opening acclamation in the burial service in The Book of Common Prayer states what I am trying to say.
        <P>
        I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
        <P>
        I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and though this body be destroyed, yet shall I see God; whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger.
        <P>
        For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself, for if we live, we live unto the Lord; and if we die, we die unto the
        <P>
        Lord. Whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.
        <P>
        Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord; even so saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labors. (2)
        <P>
        Amen. –Fr. Gage-

        <P>It rained like crazy one day last week. Like Ben, my Black Lab who died a year ago, I love bad weather. My mother was the same way. She was a Swede, and Dad always said she had been born on the prow of a Viking boat, heading into a storm. So, bad weather is not a problem for me. I pulled on my favorite Topsiders and waded out. These are wonderful shoes. I got them up at Booth Bay Harbor in Maine, and have had them for ten years. Of course, the water came right through them! My faithful all weather shirt was also drenched. I retrieved the New York Times and the Stamford Advocate, which I read before coming to work. But I couldn’t read them because I had to change my clothes. Then there were a series of phone calls, and I was off balance for the rest of the day.
        <P>
        We all have routines and patterns of behavior that we follow and depend on. They are the ways “we have always done that.” Those routines and patterns, personal and societal, are called “mores” and “folkways.” Mores are the rules and regulations, laws and requirements. Folkways are more informal, family traditions and ways we order our life. How we dress tends to be a folkway. Women wear high heels. Men don’t (except in Texas). The shoes you walk in will vary according to the culture, geographical area and function of what the wearer is doing.
        <P>
        All of this is pretty obvious until you begin to notice that men and women yearn to have a closer relationship to that which is the “Holy Other.” When men and women are called or pulled in by that which is part of the mysterium tremendum, part of the compelling force in and behind life, then things get very, very serious. We all have a desire to live in harmony with life, to find “the right relationship” to how things fit together. The Book of Job, for example, deals seriously with that problem. For the Hebrew, for the Jew, the overwhelming question was “how do you live in a right relationship with God?” For the Jews the answer was in their history and in the prophets. Their history spoke of God’s leading them to a promised land. Their prophets, like Isaiah, spoke of justice, mercy, humility and faithfulness to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The sole repository of this information was The Law. Now The Law was not just the Ten Commandments; it was the first five books of the Bible, the Pentateuch, and it was called The Torah.
        <P>
        Certain scholars specialized in studying the Law and in trying to interpret it, which they did sometimes by referring to the prophets. These men were called rabbis. Those who were “strict constructionists” and very conservative were the Sadducees. The more liberal were the Pharisees, who wanted to make things applicable to every day life. Arguing, reasoning and studying were part of what they did and how they lived.
        <P>
        Now there was a man, named Nicodemus, a Pharisee and leader of the Jews who came to Jesus by night and told Jesus that he knew that Jesus was a teacher who had come from God; for no one could do the things Jesus did unless sent from God. (A very flattering opening gambit.) Jesus speaks of being born from above. Nick rhetorically counters that one can’t re-enter the womb (a typical rabbinic rhetorical device – starting from the literal facts). Jesus replies that what is born of the Spirit is spirit and what is born of the flesh is flesh. One who is born of the Spirit and believes in the Son of Man (Son of God) will be able to enter the kingdom of heaven.
        <P>
        What Nick is being told is that the old mores and folkways, the old patterns of behavior that Israel has followed, that the Jews have followed, that the rabbis have taught – The Law – is not enough. Belief in the teachings of Jesus and in Jesus as the Son of God is the key to living a meaningful and holy life and is the key to entering the kingdom of heaven (which is in effect having a right relationship to God both now and hereafter.) In the storms of life the old shoes for the pilgrimage of faith don’t work. Our job during the fifty weeks of Pentecost is to re-examine our understandings of the nature of Jesus and His teachings and the extent to which we have incorporated them into our lives and to ask for the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
        <P>
        This process and experience is not a casual or “sometime” thing. Some years ago I was celebrating at noon when a figure appeared at the back of the sanctuary. He was stooped and lame. I bid him come in and later talked to him. We became friends. His name was “Nicholas.” Nick was a former professor at Stanford, Harvard and Yale and also an international consultant. “I used to commute on the Concorde,” he once told me. Nick’s health was rapidly deteriorating, and he was in and out of Stamford hospital, where I saw him and gave him communion. Nick had been highly successful as a “rabbi,” or expert in areas of finance and management. He had mastered the mores of our capitalist society. Nick married and divorced three times and had four adult children, with whom he had a very tenuous relationship. Each of them had been damaged by the divorces. Nick and I talked through those relationships, and he began to see where he had failed and the damaged he had done. He realized that he had neglected the area of faith and his relationship to God. Nick’s values, perspective, orientation and life turned around. He changed. Nick still was an expert in his Torah or ways of life, his management expertise, but he realized that he needed something more profound. He needed Christ as well.
        <P>
        Nick’s health tanked and his son took him out to Napa, California, where he died. The son invited me to do the funeral. My knee blew out and I could hardly walk. My son, Chris, out of the blue called up and said, “I’ll take you out.” We flew to San Francisco; I took my cane, wore a pair of sturdy shoes, and did the service. I told the family that I came out because Nick had changed. He had come to terms with his failures and blindness and was sorry. He greatly loved his children. The youngest daughter asked if Nick really loved her and knew that she loved him. I told her “Yes,” and said the same when the older daughter asked the same question. “You see,” I said to all four adult children, “I came out here to honor your father.” A man of learning, he had missed what was important, repented and learned again. In the processes through the love of God he was able to express his love for his family. He was, pardon the expression, “born again.” Was it the power of the Holy Spirit? My son, Chris, brought me home. You see, small miracles do happen every day.
        <P>
        The Nicodemus in the story from The Gospel of St. John continued to be a rabbi, paying attention to the mores and folkways, The Law, but he added to that his discipleship to Christ. He was there at the Crucifixion and prepared Jesus’ body for the tomb (in accordance with The Law). At the same time Nick recognized Jesus as the Son of God and believed in Him.
        <P>
        So too, you and I during this season of Pentecost are called to examine our assumptions and patterns of behavior, our mores and folkways, how we do things (as a parish, corporately, professionally, personally, and familially) and how we integrate Christ into the core of our being. Sometimes we need to make changes. Sometimes we need new shoes for our pilgrimage of faith. Sometimes we discover that we cannot put new wine into old wine skins. Sometimes repentance is called for. Always we need to worship and to let the Holy Spirit work God’s will in our lives. Let us go forth, rejoicing in the power of the Spirit. Alleluia. Alleluia. Amen.</P>

            <P>I had gone down to Baltimore to attend a conference, which would fulfill my annual requirement for continuing education credits. The conference was mundane and perfunctory, although I renewed some old acquaintances.
            <P>
            A little after noon on Thursday I was sitting in Penn Station in Baltimore. The New York Times was spread out before me on the lunch table. I had a two-hour wait for my train.
            <P>
            I looked up and there was a young man standing behind the chair opposite me. He was dressed in a light jacket, work shirt, khaki pants and clean work boots. A backpack was slung over his shoulders. He was clean-shaven but his eyes looked tired.
            <P>
            “You’re a Christian, aren’t you?”
            <P>
            I thought, “Oh, boy here is another panhandler who has spotted my dog collar and is looking for some change.” “Yes, I am.” I replied.
            <P>
            “My parents were Christian. They were killed in an automobile crash when I was fifteen. It sort of messed up my life.”
            <P>
            “I’m sorry to hear that. It must be hard.”
            <P>
            “Yeah. I’ve really been in and out since. I’ve used alcohol and drugs, been in and out of jail. I served three years twice.”
            <P>
            “You’re about twenty-eight, aren’t you?”
            <P>
            “Yeah. I don’t know if there is a God. I don’t know if the Buddhists or Muslims or Christians are right. I just don’t know what to think.”
            <P>
            “Have you been to AA? They talk of a “Higher Being.”
            <P>
            “Yeah,” smirk, I’ve tried it a few times but it don’t help. I mean, should I be a Christian?”
            <P>
            “I don’t know. Smarter men than you and I have struggled with the question of whether or not there is a God. If I were you I would settle on Christianity, since your parents were Christian and you probably were baptized as well. I’d leave it at that and go from there.”
            <P>
            “What are you? A priest or something?”
            <P>
            “Yes, I’m an Episcopal priest.”
            <P>
            “What’s that?”
            <P>
            “It’s one of the denominations, sort of between Roman Catholic and Protestants like Baptists, and Methodists and Congregationalists.”
            <P>
            “I don’t know any of those.”
            <P>
            “No, you probably don’t.”

            ” I’ve had a really hard time, done some stuff.”
            <P>
            “You are on something now, aren’t you?”
            <P>
            “Yeah.”
            <P>
            “What do you take?”
            <P>
            “Coke, heroin, marijuana, booze.”
            <P>
            “That doesn’t leave much out.”
            <P>
            “No. I guess it doesn’t.”
            <P>
            “I m going to tell you a story, and it is a true one. My brother’s son at age eighteen got into a fight and ended up in downstate Illinois prison. When he came out six years later he could barely talk. He got a job as an automotive mechanic and was in and out of drugs for the next twenty years. He got by on factory jobs and bummed around. He died at age fifty from rectal cancer. It was long, slow and painful. He was tended by his sister. But what was remarkable was that about five years before he died he met a Roman Catholic priest who befriended him. My nephew became a Roman Catholic and he found meaning and direction in his life. When he died he had people who cared about him and he was at peace with much of his life. He died a good death.”
            <P>
            “I suggest that you find a Roman Catholic Church and see if you can find a priest who will listen to you and try to help you. You cannot take care of yourself alone nor deal with your problems and questions alone. You need the support and help of others. You have been trying to do it alone and haven’t gotten very far.”
            <P>
            “Do you have a job?”
            <P>
            “Yes, I work in a restaurant.”
            <P>
            “What are you doing here?”
            <P>
            “I am on my way to see someone. I have some vacation time.”
            <P>
            “Good. You know, you are a good person. Don’t forget that.”
            <P>
            “Yeah. You know, I think the Holy Ghost is here with us.”
            <P>
            Surprised, I looked at him and said, “Well, the Holy Spirit has a sense of humor and sometimes appears when we least expect it, pushing and prodding and moving us along. Do you mind if I say a prayer?”
            <P>
            “Oh God, be with this young man as he continues on his way. Keep him safe and well and free from harm. Guide, guard and protect him. Help him in his questions and in his desire to find meaning and purpose in his life. Be with him as he continues on his journey. This we ask in the name of Jesus Christ, our savior. Amen.”
            <P>
            “Thank you,” he said and left.
            <P>
            I sat there a while; it felt as though I had been in a wrinkle of time, a box of a moment. I had heard confession. I had given absolution. I had not considered what I should say, I just spoke. He, in turn, just reacted to my being there.
            <P>
            I thought of how the coming of the Holy Spirit is often announced with great bombast by Pentecostal preachers, or oozed by the self-conscious overly spiritually pietistic. The young man could very well be right. The Holy Spirit does come in the midst of train stations and conversations. It does not immediately cure addiction or despair. But often it brings a life giving moment of grace. For that I give thanks, and I pray for my friend.</P>
