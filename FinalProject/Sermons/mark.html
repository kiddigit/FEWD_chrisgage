        <P>
        When I was a boy, growing up in Illinois, I learned that there were three things you didn’t talk about: religion, politics and sex. You stayed away from talking about politics because in Chicago it was crooked. You stayed away from talking about sex because you were too young. You stayed away from talking about religion because it was too volatile a subject. Too many families and nations and peoples have been split asunder by controversies over religion. I did not follow my parent’s admonitions. I got married, avidly followed national politics and went into the religion business. So much for the power of the mores of Midwest Protestantism!
        <P>
        I want to talk a little bit to you this morning about religion in general. Then I want to mention the function of myths, language and folktales. Finally I will tell you a story. My wife says that like Jesus, I will “have already told you everything” when I’m done.
        <P>
        First about religion. Religion is a very serious matter. Religion is about our worldview, our view of life. It shapes, defines and motivates our behavior and our ideas. Religion includes our beliefs, practices and faith. Religion is about man’s eternal quest for God; or, if you prefer, Gods eternal quest for man. Often we tend to underestimate the power and scope of religion. We think that the secular worldview, the scientific worldview, the agnostic’s worldview and the worldview of atheism are non-religious. They can, however, function very much like traditional religions in that they make ultimate claims about the ultimate nature of reality and man’s relationship to the principles of the universe. The secular man worships at the altar of success, power, prestige or some other ultimate good. For a common everyday example of an idol, take a look sometime at the Oscar statue in the motion picture industry. The so-called non-religious world has its messiahs, idols and gods, but is often more circumspect in naming them than is the overtly religious world.
        <P>
        We ignore religion and its power at our peril. Mainline churches discount the Pentecostal, charismatic and fundamental churches. Orthodox, confessional and sacramental churches are smugly tempted to discount the power of animism, mysticism (the Sufis), oriental and major world religions. I have for a long time felt that our state department has underestimated the tremendous power of religion in third world countries (such as the Whabbis in Saudi Arabia). Sometimes, it seems to me, there is an attitude in institutions of a false sense of progressive perfectionism and evolutionism. “Those poor people in Africa, with or without their bishops and imams, are simple naive and childish. Wrong. They are far more tuned in to things in a way in which the cultural elite often totally underestimates. Often they are keenly aware of the over-powering force of the mysterium tremendum, the Holy Other, which Judaism celebrates in its story of Moses on the Mountain and Christianity in its Passion narrative. Sometimes it takes a book like Conrad’s Heart of Darkness or a movie like Apocalypse Now to remind us of the power of evil and the existence of what St. Paul calls “principalities and powers.”
        <P>
        Now to speak for a moment about language, folktales and myths. We make sense of our lives through telling stories. All cultures, societies and families do this. “When I was a child we used toŠ.” These are the introductory words to what you and I recognize is going to be a short tale told by an older person, an aunt, uncle or parent. Every society and every religion generates folktales and myths, which contain observations, principles and truths. So myths are about truths, but they are not necessarily always logically true or scientifically demonstrable. For example, “the Chicago Cubs live under the curse of the man who could not bring in a goat.” The truth in that myth is that there seems to be some inexorable reason why the Cubs are congenitally incompetent. In the broader realm the religion of secularism and agnosticism will often posit that “all religions are alike.” Not true. There are huge differences. But the point is being made that there are commonalities among religions. I’ve heard intellectuals and people of good will say, “We ultimately all worship the same god.” No we don’t. There may be a force of energy and will in creation, but we don’t all worship that. Some worship idols and some mammon (success or money).
        <P>
        The Old Testament is full of myths and folktales. Genesis presents the story of creation. The stories of The Flood or of Sodom and Gomorrah combine both mythological and folk elements. You will find in the Old Testament that there is a constant struggle by the Hebrews against false gods, values and religions which exploit individuals, society and the piety of religious people. Hence we have Elijah railing against Ba-alism, which encouraged temple prostitution and human sacrifice. Not without their own faults, over and over the Jews struggled against the temptations of apostasy and hedonism. Hence we have prophetic literature and the constant warnings to Israel and Judah to keep the commandments and to stay on track. Specific truths are presented in the prophetic literature about the nature of God and the nature of faithful obedience. Justice and mercy must kiss each other, as the psalmist notes. False messiahs bring pyrrhic victories.
        <P>
        When Jesus preached to the people of Israel, He was speaking to a people who had lived under the occupation of the Greco-Roman empire. Previous conquerors had been driven out and replaced by the Romans, who brought their gods and their religions. The Book of Daniel uses mythical and apocalyptic language to describe the travails of Israel, to urge the people to be faithful and to offer a vision of hope. In today’s Gospel reading Jesus uses the same kind of language to bring a sense of urgency. Jesus speaks of the last days, of cataclysmic events and of false messiahs. He is pointing to specific truths which are central to his message. They are these: God has acted. God is present in His life. Salvation is to be found in following Jesus. Pay attention. Enough said.
        <P>
        Those are the same truths which the Church proclaims today. God has acted. God is present in the life of Christ (and in the life of the Church which is His body). Salvation is found in following Jesus. Listen up. Be alert. Work it out. Enough said.
        <P>
        You and I do all of that. We proclaim the Gospel in our lives, in our sacraments, in our teaching, in our song, in our stewardship and in our charity. Through our lives and through the stories we tell and the myths that we uphold in our lives, we praise God who is our help in ages past and we stand up for Jesus. We stand over against the false gods of mammon and success, of secularism and nihilism. We stand for a faith in a creator and redeemer God who cares for each and every one of us. That is our message.
        <P>
        Time for a story. My wife is the executive director of the Connecticut Writing Project. That organization teaches teachers to teach writing. Its goal is to get kids writing at all grade levels. Faye has been working with the teachers in Groton, Connecticut. Many of the children are from the Navy base there. The schools are poor and there is a turn over each year of one third of the students. Even so, the teachers soldier on, trying to inspire and to get the children to write. Here is a story written by a seven year old. Angles Story. (Note the spelling.) Once long long ago, there was an angel who love God more than the others. Her name was Moira. She prayed to God every morning and every night. But her sisters did not. If they did not they would be punished. So she need to help them! She begged them to pray, but they would not! She was the wrongest person, no wonder they would not listen to her. She was doomed! Find out what happened to her on Moira 2! Remember when Moira was ignored? Well one day she went to God. She said, “God, I’ve come to tell you my sisters will not pray to you!. Please don’t hurt them.” But God did not do anything to hurt my sisters. He just said, “This is the girl who loved her sisters even if they did not pray to me.” Here is God picking me up! He said, “You and your sisters are free! You no longer need to be in my presence. Remember me.” I will. So I jumped in a hole. I was on land. I found a man. I said to be friends. We lived happy ever after. The End.
        <P>
        Through story telling and myth making this seven year old articulated some profound truths: love, compassion, forgiveness, charity and hope. She added the American dream of a happy family and a happy life ever hereafter. But isn’t that the dream of people in every society and every country? The seven year old had grasped the central truths of our faith. What a blessing! And now, “I have already told you everything.” Amen.</P>

        <P>“Young folks, old folks, everybody come, come to our little church and have a lot of fun. Please leave your chewing gum and erasers at the door and you’ll hear some Bible stories that you never heard before.”
        <P>
        Today another Bible story! Last week we had the stilling of the storm and the healing of the Gerasene Demoniac. Those two events are part of the nature and healing miracles, which Jesus performed. They convict us that in the midst of natural and mental chaos God rules. They tell us that there is order, renewal and the assurance of God’s love in the midst of our lives. Our job is to tell others about what God in Christ has done for us.
        <P>
        Today’s Gospel story is in the tradition of the miracle/healing narratives, and is often referred to as “The raising of Jairus’ daughter.” Jairus was a man of great learning, a leader in the synagogue. He had both knowledge and position. He also had a twelve-year-old daughter, who was on the verge of death. The mother and women moaned and groaned over the daughter, who was unresponsive. At his wits’ end, Jairus pled with Jesus to come and make his daughter well. Jesus told Jairus that his daughter was not dead but sleeping. The mourners laughed at Jesus. So He came, took the girl by the hand, and told her to get up. Behold, she woke up and got up! The mourners were astounded. Jesus told them to giver her something to eat and to keep the incident to themselves. Which, obviously, they didn’t do.
        <P>
        You and I can speculate as to whether the girl had a sleeping sickness or coma, but the story doesn’t really answer those questions. This is also not overtly a story about someone having been raised from the dead. It is, however, a story about the prescience of Jesus, his ability to see into a level of reality that others miss. Those of you, who know your Bible, will recognize that the story echoes the healing miracles done by the prophets Elijah and Elisha. So the story is also saying that in Jesus, God has revealed the power of the prophets, power to make change and to see more clearly what is to be and also to see into the nature of reality.
        <P>
        So the awakening of Jairus’ daughter is a neat story. It is also evocative and touches our all too human condition. As you know, I always have a handful of stories that parallel or play off a Bible story. I am going to tell a couple again today, because they help us “read, mark, and inwardly digest” this Bible story.
        <P>
        Like the women and naysayers, you and I often miss seeing into a level of reality. We are stuck on appearances and complaining, and fail to reach into the level of reality where there is creativity, hope and renewal.
        <P>
        Case in point: Some time ago, Faye and I came back from Old Saybrook. When we got home, Faye was alarmed. “Where is my computer?” “What computer?” “The one in the black case that I took to the beach?” “Where did you put it?” “If I knew, I wouldn’t be asking! It has all of my St Luke’s Lifeworks’ reports on it, plus all of my material for the Connecticut Writing Project and the workshops I am doing this week. I’ve searched the Caravan over and over. Go out and see if I missed it” So I went over the Caravan thoroughly. No computer. “I’ll have to get back in the car and drive to Old Saybrook and get it, because I have a meeting in three hours!” “I can go.” “No. there won’t be time. I have to go!” Wishing to spare her the trip, I went out and searched the caravan, again. There, flat on the black floor, behind the driver’s seat, was the computer. I brought it in, and Faye was on the sofa, crying from frustration. Teasing her a little, I said, “I don’t want you to go back to Old Saybrook.” Glare. “Here is your computer!” For a moment, Faye didn’t know whether to clobber me for teasing her, or to hail me as a hero. So she did neither.
        <P>
        The point of the story is this. You and I often move on the level of appearances, which seems to make sense and to be valid. But sometimes when we drop down to a lower level of reality, we are able to see and to find that which we so greatly need. That is what Jesus did. He saw beyond appearances that there is life, not death, at a deeper level of reality.
        <P>
        Second story. Joe was one of the finest men I ever knew. He was a Mainiac, not from Gerasa, but from Maine. Tall, thin, laconic and keenly intelligent, a lawyer, he was a man of position in his company and in the community. Born and bred in New England, he carried on the tradition of Emerson and the Transcendentalists, in that he was more of a deist or theist, than a red blooded Christian. He tolerated traditional Christianity, but preferred to be, at best, a lapsed Congregationalist. Joe had an adult daughter, who was married in their back yard by a justice of the peace. Joe was bemused by my becoming a priest and was respectful, but patently skeptical about “the whole religious thing.”
        <P>
        One Saturday morning I was having coffee with Ben, when Joe appeared at my back door. “Neighbor,” he said. “I have a favor to ask, seeing as how you are a padre and all. My daughter, she’s got the cancer and is to be operated on. Could you say a prayer for her?” “Sure, Joe. I’d be honored to.” So we held each other while I prayed. “Much obliged,” Joe said and disappeared. Ten days later Joe, my modern day Jairus, reported that the operation was successful. “They got all the cancer and she’s doing fine.” A year and a half later she had a baby girl.
        <P>
        Now the awakening of Jairus’ daughter and the healing of Joe’s daughter while on the one hand are comforting, on the other hand they are infuriating. We want to say, “Why wasn’t my daughter cured? Why wasn’t my husband healed?”
        <P>
        There is no easy answer to the pain and sincerity of those questions. But the Bible story isn’t talking about every illness or loss. <ital>It is pointing to the nature and power of Jesus and it is challenging you and me to move into that area of reality that is below appearances.</ital> It was when Jairus dropped his reliance on education, learning, and status that he was able to go to Jesus, to persist and to bring his daughter to the power of the prophets and of God in Christ. This is not to deprecate education and status; it just means that Jairus got down to basics, as a husband and a parent.
        <P>
        When Jesus says that the girl is not dead, but sleeping, He is foreshadowing His resurrection. He is also pointing to the promise of life after death, to the reality of individual life at a more basic level of reality than that of appearances and sickness and death.
        <P>
        A final story. My mother-in-law, Gladys, was 93 years old and dying at Courtland Garden Nursing Home. She had been failing markedly. At ten in the morning the floor nurse called and said, “Gladys is dying; I don’t think she will last the night.” “How is she?” “Well, she is barely breathing, there is almost no heart beat or pulse.” So I rushed over to the nursing home, where a very somber nurse greeted me. “How is Gladys?”  “I don’t think she will last until six.” Faye arrived and asked how her mother was. “Well, there is no pulse, no breathing, and no heart beat, but she is doing as well as can be expected. I don’t think she will last until noon.”  So I went in and anointed Gladys, said the prayers for the time of death and stroked her hair. Crooning I said, “Gladys, you’re going to be with Charlie and your parents, and your daughter and grand-daughter.” Then because I always teased her, I added, “I know you will miss housework, washing the blinds, scrubbing the floors, cleaning the stove.” Gladys sat bolt upright and said, “In a pig’s ear I will!” and lay back down. The nurse’ jaw dropped. Faye said, “He’s done it again.”  I turned and left.
        <P>
        Gladys, to all appearances, was unconscious. But at a very deep level of reality, at the subconscious, she was quite present. With Jairus’ daughter, Jesus reached to the subconscious and the deeper level of reality and pointed to life – life which is present in the here-and-now and which extends to the hereafter.
        <P>
        <ital>Today’s Bible story calls us to see beyond appearances, to wake up to the deeper realities in life, and amidst the chaos and sorrows of life to move away from the nay-sayers and in to those realms in which God is present with compassion and hope, love and redemption.</ital>
        <P>
        Likewise, as we deal with the issues which we have not only in our own lives but in society, we need to go beyond appearances and deal with the deeper realities behind the issues of society and life: food, clothing, education, health and shelter. Personally and collectively you and I are called by Jesus, <ital>to wake up, deal with and look at the deeper levels of reality, where God works and where there is always life and redemption, love and hope.
        <P>
        And that is what we do at the Mass this morning.<ital> Amen.</P>

            <P>One hot Saturday evening this past August Faye and I drove over the causeway which connects Fenwick Point with Saybrook Point. To the West of the causeway is South Cove and to the East is the mouth of the Connecticut River, which opens into Long Island Sound. At the North end of the causeway is the Dock and Dine Restaurant and the Saybrook Point Marina, which harbors five to ten million dollars worth of boats. To the south is the exclusive area of Fenwick, the home of Katherine Hepburn and a lush golf course. Usually there are a scattering of sport fishermen on the causeway, but that night there were cars parked helter-skelter along the road. People opened doors onto the highway and meandered back and forth across the road. Children wadded in the muck of the wetlands and old and young huddled in clumps around fishing poles. I was annoyed by these brown skinned people, for they were in my way and I was late for our dinner date at the restaurant. It wasn’t until I reached the end of the causeway that I realized that many of the men and women wore clothes which were common to India, Pakistan, the Far East and Central America. These people were not sport fishermen. They were fishing for food. They were sending their children out into the muck, where I wouldn’t let my Labrador Retriever go, to dig for shell fish. Here between two extremes of wealth in our society were people foraging for food. I was stunned. Dinner that night somehow lost its flavor.

            There is a growing dichotomy within our society between the haves and the have-nots. The underground cash economy in our country is huge, bigger than the gross national products of many other countries. Neither The Great Society nor the high tech data commerce of our present economy has wiped out poverty. Fishermen, loggers, truckers, farmers, factory workers are impoverished. Many cities have cracked down on quality of life crimes and “cleaned up” their towns. When the president comes to visit, the homeless and the poor are swept out of sight, only to seep back in at a later time. Too often those who do have jobs in many communities are the “working poor,” who eke out a living by working at both Home Depot and MacDonalds.

            You and I are held to very high standards by the prophets of our religion who call for justice, righteousness and mercy. Hosea reminds us: ” ‘So you, by the help of your God, return, hold fast to love and justice, and wait continually for your God.’ A trader, in whose hands are false balances, he loves to oppress. Ephraim has said, ‘Ah, but I am rich, I have gained wealth for myself’; but all his riches can never offset the guilt he has incurred.” (Hos.12:6-7)
            <P>
            And Amos tells us, ” ‘Therefore because you trample upon the poor and take from him exactions of wheat, you have built houses of hewn stone, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink their wine. For I know how many are your transgressions, and how great are your sins, you who afflict the righteous, who take a bribe, and turn aside the needy in the gate.” (Amos 5:10-12)
            <P>
            How often you and I feel (as I did that Saturday night) convicted by the plight of the poor and the calls for justice and righteousness of Amos and Hosea! We make our peace much like the rich young ruler by saying, “Hey, I’m not so bad. I keep to a pretty good set of rules. I don’t murder, divorce or steal. I keep the commandments pretty well. I’m a fairly decent sort of guy.” Like the Pharisees we test God. “I keep the Deuteronomic Law. I work hard. Good things come to me most of the time. So I’m okay. Right Jesus? Right?” Under our public facade of well being there is a deep uncertainty, an anxiety, that pushes us. “I’m okay, Jesus, aren’t I? You like me, right? We’re okay? Our relationship to you is good. We’re, how do you say it, entering the Kingdom of God. We’re going to have eternal life, right?” Jesus looks at us as He did at the rich young man. Jesus looked at him and He LOVED him. Jesus looks at us with love, a love more profound than that of a mother for a child or a spouse for the beloved one. Jesus begins with love, accompanied by acceptance and grace. He then reminds us of the two great commandments: love of God and love of neighbor.(1) Jesus’ conversation with the rich young man, and with us, is really the same as when He was asked which were the greatest commandments. In our Marcan passage Jesus speaks to the young man’s specific situation and tells him to sell all he has and to give to the poor. Then he is to follow Jesus. The rich man is to love his neighbor and to love God as manifested in God’s Son. Interestingly the young man is the only one called in the New Testament who does not then follow Jesus. For the rich young man has great possessions. He is possessed by his possessions. Jesus calls for an ultimate commitment to an ultimate God who is seen in an ultimate revelation. This call is parallel to Jesus’ admonition elsewhere to “let the dead bury the dead”(2) and to “leave father and mother.” (3)

            The ironic paradox is that by heeding Christ’s call, you and I escape works’ righteousness and receive God’s grace. In effect you and I repent. We turn around and, as Harry Wendt, when he gave his talk here on the parables pointed out, we see that all that we have is not ours but our Creator and Redeemer’s, God’s. We understand that you and I are entrusted with the responsibility for conscientious stewardship of all we possess. Our time, our talents, our estate, our crises, our failings and our debts - all that you and I have is entrusted to us to present before and to return to God. Not only are the good things in our life, but also the bad things in our life are given to us to deal with responsibily. Illness, failure, rejection can become occasions for a deeper sense of the presence of God, just as health, success and acceptance can (and should) develop our sense of God’s bountiful goodness. All that is entrusted to us is to be returned to God, to be used to further the condition of our neighbor and those in need AND to glorify God by propagating the Gospel and bringing souls closer to God through the Church. Charity and salvation are inextricably linked.
            <P>
            You and I can use what we have to help others and to glorify God through prayer, service, social responsibility and through the specific outlets of the church such as the Presiding Bishop’s Fund, the Bishop’s Fund for Children and such outreach programs as St. Luke’s Life Works. We can pledge generously to the parish and dedicate a portion of our estate in our will to the life and outreach of the church. Through worship and fellowship you and I support our neighbor and experience the life of Christ in others. Through the sacraments you and I rededicate ourselves to Christ and receive the grace of forgiveness and renewal by the Holy Spirit. In some respects the Church is a bridge (or a causeway) between the kingdom of God in this world and the kingdom of God in the next. Our faith journies in the Church provide you and me with a plethora of challenges and possibilities waiting for us to accept them.
            <P>
            Last Saturday Faye and I drove across the causeway in Old Saybrook on our way to dinner at the Dock and Dine. Boats rose and fell in the harbor. The sports fishermen, a half dozen or so, had returned to the causeway. The poor and the hungry were gone. They were out of sight. Somehow I found that very scary. Lord have mercy upon us. Christ have mercy upon us. Amen. - Fr. Gage
